# Fork-Feast-Test_Automation_Website
Fork &amp; Feast is a food recipe and blog website automated using Selenium, Maven and TestNG on Eclipse IDE to test its functionality, performance and user interface efficiently.

Fork & Feast is a web-based food recipe and blog platform developed as a full-stack project integrating both frontend and backend components. The platform allows users to explore a variety of recipes and blog posts related to food, cooking tips and meal planning. 

For robust quality assurance and performance validation, the website is thoroughly automated using Selenium WebDriver for browser-based testing, TestNG for managing test execution and assertions, and Maven as the build automation tool to handle project dependencies and test suite configurations. All development and automation processes were carried out in the Eclipse IDE. The backend is connected to a MongoDB database, enabling smooth data handling and dynamic content display. This project not only demonstrates end-to-end web development but also emphasizes modern testing practices and automation frameworks used in industry-standard QA processes.
